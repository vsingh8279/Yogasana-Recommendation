# Yoga-Asana-Recommendation-Model

## **Abstract**

This project, titled "Yoga Asana Library," explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and text analytics to understand and interpret text documents. The focus is on developing a model that recommends suitable yoga poses based on user-defined constraints and preferences.

The primary objective is to create a recommendation system that suggests yoga poses tailored to the user's needs, including desired benefits, age, contraindications, and the level of difficulty. 

To achieve this, datasets were curated from reputable sources and underwent pre-processing steps, including tokenization, stop words removal, and the use of regular expressions, implemented with the Python Gensim library. Since machine learning models require numerical representations of text, various word vectorization techniques—such as one-hot encoding, Word2Vec, and TF-IDF—were employed to generate word embeddings. An Artificial Neural Network was then developed to leverage these embeddings and provide accurate yoga pose recommendations.
